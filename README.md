# US keyboard layout with ISO key
Combine the simplicity of the US keyboard with the usability of the ISO key.

## Motivation
The presence of the ISO key in absence of altGr and dead key combos enables oh-so-clever software (like Supermicro iKVM) to use ISO key dependent keyboard layouts.  
In fact, frustration with that is the sole reason why I made these (OK, I love to frankenstein things, too).

## Variants

### `sgisousy.klc`
The ISO key (VK_OEM_102) produces Swiss German output.  

### `sgisousz.klc`
The same, but with QWERTZ keys.

## Installation
I will not release binary files to the world.  
Use Microsoft [Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134) to build an installer from the .klc file.
